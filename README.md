# Interactive-Map-Part1

Tailored Travel is in the process of building their new app to improve the traveler experience. You've been hired on as an independent contractor to handle the mapping and localization functionality for the app. One of the main features needed is for the user to be able to quickly locate local businesses. At the very least, the application must do the following:

Obtain the user's current location.
Map the location on a Leaflet map.
Allow the user to select a business type from a list and map the five nearest locations on the map using the Foursquare API.
You will work independently on this project, but remember the instructor is available if needed. Consider at least three different resources when you run into a problem, or spend at least 5 minutes on the issue before reaching out.

There is no starter code for this project; however, a repository containing a potential solution is available here. Do your best to complete this project from scratch. Since there are so many ways to build an application, your code will vary from the solution code. The goal is to meet the minimum specifications. Completing items from the bonus list will make your code vary substantially.

1. Set up Your Project
Consider the files you will need to create this application.

What should you name your files?
How will you connect your files?
How will you test that the files are connected properly and loading as expected?
Which of the following is not a valid way to add JavaScript to your project?

Using the script tag in the header with defer
Using the link tag in the header with asyncCorrect!
Using the script tag before the closing body tag
Note: Internal CSS is fine for this project; however, if you plan to build out the project substantially, using an external CSS file is preferable.

2. Design Your Application
Use comments and pseudocode to map the functionality of your application. When writing pseudocode, think through the functionality you need to create. How would you describe the functionality required for the application to work?

What events will your application need?
What APIs will you need and in what order?
How will you obtain the user's location?
How will you add the user's location to the map?
How will you get the selected location from the user?
How will you add that information to the map?
3. Create a User Interface
Add a simple select interface for the user with the following values: coffee, restaurant, hotel, and market. Next, create a space where you will place your map.

4. Reflect
View your project in the browser. At this point, you should have a good idea of what you need to accomplish and the steps you need to take, even if you're not yet sure how to complete those steps. Have you already thought of some things that could improve this application?

Bonus
If you have time, try adding more elements and/or styles to your user interface to improve the design and user experience. Alternatively, you can read about the Foursquare API.
